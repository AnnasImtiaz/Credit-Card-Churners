The Thera bank recently saw a steep decline in the number of users of their credit card, creditcards are a good source of income for banks because of
different kinds of fees charged by thebanks like annual fees, balance transfer fees, and cash advance fees, late payment fees, foreigntransaction fees, and others.
Some fees are charged on every user irrespective of usage, whileothers are charged under specified circumstances.
Customers’ leaving credit cards services would lead bank to loss, so the bank wants to analyzethe data of customers’ and identify the customers who will leave their
credit card services andreason for same – so that bank could improve upon those areas

You as a Data scientist at Thera bank need to come up with a classification model that will helpbank improve their services so that customers do not renounce
their credit cards
